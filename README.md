# Space Invaders

I followed along Chris's tutorial to build this game. And how much I have learned along the way about implementing logic in JavaScript! I highly recommend for anyone learning JavaScript, and actually applying the usual concepts from other courses. I had a fun week of building his games (Mario and Pacman too), and I love the way he approaches certain things, and how good he comments his code and teaches along the way. Thank you Chris.
